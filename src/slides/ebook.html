      almost always have a screen in mind. A laptop screen, or a smartphone screen. Maybe even a tablet screen. But always a screen. The thunder finally came: the storm was close.

    It is also true that cellphones aren't made to read long content comfortably. They are getting longer and longer, they tire your eyes with their backlights, their readability
    under natural light usually sucks and maybe the screen is cracked. Which may be fine for small interactions, not much for longer reads.
