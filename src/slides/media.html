    <h1>Are our media accessible?</h1>
    <p>
      When we develop for our stylesheet, we almost always have a screen in mind. A laptop screen, or a smartphone screen. Maybe even a tablet screen. But always a screen.
      <img src="img/qr-slides.svg" alt="" style="width: 6em; float: inline-end; margin-inline-start: 0.5em" />
    </p>
    <p>
      But it hasn't been always like this. On the contrary, one of the first media we've used to access information didn't involve a screen at all. It didn't even involve an input
      device, RAM or a CPU. It was just paper. Printed paper. And even before, written paper. And before that, written stone or wax.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, CSS didn't even exist back then. And neither did HTML. But that doesn't mean that putting things on paper is a thing of the past. After all, it was still the
      <em>main</em> information exchange medium when CSS was conceived, so it's only natural that it's been the first medium to be targeted by special styling after the screen.
